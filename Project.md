## Project 1 is my Master’s thesis project:</br>
I will mention shortly the important parts of this projects and techniques I used.
I made use of Natural language processing techniques like: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, punctation, lowercasing..</br>
Experience in Pyspark and SQL, since I got my data from databases. Mainly programmed in Python and jupyter notbooks. I made use of complex custom neural network (using Keras), and created them by myself. So I did not used  core machine learning algorithms during this project such as: LogisticRegression, Decision Tree. But I have of course experience with these kind of algorithms. Moreover, I made use of confusion matrices and other visualization/analyzing methods.</br>

## Project 2 is a project were I worked on extending my knowledge in Pytorch Neural networks:</br>
In this project I am using structured and unstructured data features, and the goal is to predict the position of football players in the field.</br>
I made use Pytorch in order to create a neural network.</br>

## Project 3 Is a image classification project:</br>
Predicting the type of flower in an image, using convolutional neural network. With the use of Keras.
So this project needs to process an image as input data, and is more deep learning related.</br>
